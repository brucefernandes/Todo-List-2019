# Todo-List-2019
A small summer project that I am working on in order to better my understanding of web development with Django


How to Use:

1.First download all the files that I have uploaded.
2.Make sure you have django and python installed. 
3.Open the shell that you use and create a virtual environment. This can vary from operating system to operating system
